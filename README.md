# 100 Machine Learning Projects in 100 Days

## Introduction
Welcome to my 100 Days of Machine Learning Challenge! This repository is dedicated to documenting my journey of learning and building machine learning projects every day for 100 days. My primary goal is to deepen my understanding of various machine learning concepts, algorithms, and applications by applying them to real-world datasets.

## Daily Log
I will update this section daily with a summary of what I worked on, along with links to the code and any related documentation:

  * Day 1 : Disease prediction using Machine Learning
  * Day 2 : Autism Prediction Using Machine Learning
  * Day 3 : 

## Project Overview
Each day’s project will be organized in its own folder, containing:

  * Code: Python scripts or Jupyter notebooks implementing the day’s work.
  * Datasets: Any datasets used for the project.
  * Documentation: A README or notes explaining the project, methodologies, and key learnings.
